# Animatronic WorkBench (AWB)

## Great animatronics without programming knowledge

- Manual control **and** 24/7 automatic animatronic movements
- Easy to use, no programming knowledge required
- Open source, free to use 
- Create movements with a graphical editor
- Supports cheap [ESP32 microcontrollers](https://amzn.to/4lntDs9), many different servo motors and other hardware
- Hardware MP3 player (e.g. [YX5300](https://amzn.to/4kVau15) or [DFPlayer](https://amzn.to/4nbh1pT)) playback synchronized with movements

## What is the Animatronic Workbench?

In my previous animatronics projects, I always had a lot of fun with the hardware, but then I didn't put so much energy into programming the movements. 
That's a shame, because it's the movements that make the characters come alive.

The reason was that it really is *programming*, i.e. every movement had to be written in program code. 
This is quite tedious, often looks choppy as a result and has to be recompiled and started again and again to try it out.

For this reason, I have developed the software "Animatronic Workbench" (AWB).

This allows you to create the movements of animatronic figures on the screen without any programming knowledge. [Have a loot at some animatronics I built with it](https://daniel.springwald.de/category/Animatronics).
