# Animatronic WorkBench (AWB)

## Desktop editor and thin clients to choreograph animatronic movements

In my previous animatronics projects, I always had a lot of fun with the hardware, but then I didn't put so much energy into programming the movements. 
That's a shame, because it's the movements that make the characters come alive.

The reason was that it really is *programming*, i.e. every movement had to be written in program code. 
This is quite tedious, often looks choppy as a result and has to be recompiled and started again and again to try it out.

For this reason, I have developed the software "Animatronic Workbench" (AWB).

This allows you to create the movements of animatronic figures on the screen without any programming knowledge. 
The first practical use of the software was with my [animatronic Grogu](https://daniel.springwald.de/post/Animatronic-Grogu-EN).
